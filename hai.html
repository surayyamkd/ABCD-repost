        <P>HTML5 was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
            <U> The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

<h2>HTML</h2>
        <b> was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008
            </b>,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]
<h3>HTML</h3>
         HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
